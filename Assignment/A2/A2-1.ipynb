    "Data scientists often spend 80% of their time on [data preparation](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html). If your career goal is to become a data scientist, you have to master data cleaning and data integration skills. In this assignment, you will learn how to solve the Entity Resolution (ER) problem, a very common problem in data cleaning and integration. After completing this assignment, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n",

    "1. What is ER?\n",

Thus, the ER result should be a set of identified matching pairs, denoted by R. One thing that we want to know is that what percentage of the pairs in $R$ that are truly matching? This is what Precision can tell us. Let $T$ denote the truly matching pairs in $R$. Precision is defined as:\n",
