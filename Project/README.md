Interested in exploring Data Science application in Quantitative Finance, we aim to achieve the following goals:
- Develop a scalable yet effective machine learning framework that can identify high-return stocks to guide investment decisions
- Eliminate emotional bias and adopt effective features and algorithm to construct investment portfolio 
- Outperform the index benchmark in terms of % return and risk (maximum loss %)
